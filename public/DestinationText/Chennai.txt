01. Chennai

"The Detroit Of India”

Formerly known as Madras, Chennai is the capital city of the state of
Tamil Nadu, in the southern part of India. Located on the Coromandel coast
of Bay of Bengal, Chennai is as dynamic as it is immersed in tradition. This
“capital of the south’, is one among the four metropolitan siblings of India,
having a rich cultural history which it perfectly balances with its metropolis
lifestyle.

Amid its chaos of traffic and sweltering humid climate, Chennai is
worth visiting for its temples steeped in south-Indian culture, British-era
museums and monuments, culinary delights and Marina Beach (Second
largest urban beach in the world). Chennai's skyline is famous for its towering
skyscrapers, but the heart of Chennai has an old-world charm to it that
refuses to be overshadowed
