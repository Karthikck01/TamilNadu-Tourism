        Best Time To Visit The best time to visit Tamil Nadu is during the
        winter season, ie. from November to February when the temperature is
        relatively low, and pleasant to explore the attractions in the state.
        Monsoons bring torrential downpour which makes it an inappropriate time
        to travel through Tamil Nadu. Summer, however, is perfect for exploring
        the hills stations. Tourists can pick the region they wish to see
        according to the season because offseason visits could be extremely
        inconvenient for some.
